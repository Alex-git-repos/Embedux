  This project aims to be miminal, optimized, and no more than it has to be. More customizable than Arch, no harder than Ubuntu, if you're running an embeded computer, this ought to be the best.
  You may use this on any system, and it's sure to run very smoothly.

# Contributions are strictly reviewed and heavily moderated.
Always secure, never dangerous.

# Modular
  This system is very simple. You can add to the filesystem by suggesting and commiting a new Root FS structure, and load in any module when you'd like by using one of the basic commands in the wiki.
  
# Want to help?
  You can add to anything! Work on the package manager (pkg), make a customized Root FS archive, develop an Img, or whatever else!
