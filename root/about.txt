You've found your way to the root fs!
Here's what each folder is and does:
--bins: holds executable binaries for all apps and commands.
--boot: holds bootloader, kernel image, and dtbs.
--etc: personal directory for workspaces, containers, project, and whatever else. Programs may use.
--pkg: holds the pkg package manager, as well as it's repositories, and other package/program data.
--utils: programming utilities, like headers, libraries, and compilers.
